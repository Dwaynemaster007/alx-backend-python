## ‚ú® Project Overview

Welcome to the **python-generators-0x00** project! This is a core part of the **ALX Backend Web Pro-Development curriculum**. This project delves into the power of Python generators, a fundamental concept for building memory-efficient and scalable applications.

The goal is to master the `yield` keyword to handle large datasets, implement lazy loading for pagination, and perform memory-efficient computations‚Äîall critical skills for a backend developer.

## üåü Key Concepts & Objectives

* **Memory Efficiency:** Learn how generators work under the hood to handle massive datasets without consuming excessive memory.
* **Database Streaming:** Implement generators that stream data directly from an SQL database, one row at a time.
* **Batch Processing:** Build a generator that fetches and processes data in manageable batches.
* **Lazy Loading:** Simulate fetching paginated data from a database, only retrieving the next "page" when needed.
* **Aggregate Functions:** Use generators to compute metrics like the average age of users without loading the entire dataset into memory.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project and get the database ready for your scripts.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
* Python 3.x
* MySQL Server
* Git

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/alx-backend-python/python-generators-0x00.git](https://github.com/alx-backend-python/python-generators-0x00.git)
    cd python-generators-0x00
    ```
2.  **Set Up the Virtual Environment**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    source venv/Scripts/activate # On Windows (Git Bash)
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Database Seeding**
    The `seed.py` script will create the `ALX_prodev` database and populate it with sample user data.
    ```bash
    python seed.py
    ```

## üìÇ Project Structure & Usage

The project is structured with multiple tasks, each corresponding to a specific learning objective. The main files you will be working on are:
* `seed.py`: Connects to and populates the MySQL database.
* `0-stream_users.py`: Streams database rows one-by-one using a generator.
* `1-batch_processing.py`: Processes data in memory-efficient batches.
* `2-lazy_paginate.py`: Simulates lazy loading of paginated data.
* `4-stream_ages.py`: Calculates an aggregate function (average age) without a SQL query.

## üí° Key Takeaway

Generators are more than just a syntactic feature‚Äîthey are a powerful tool for building **scalable and resource-efficient** applications. This project solidifies your understanding of how to use `yield` to solve real-world backend challenges.
